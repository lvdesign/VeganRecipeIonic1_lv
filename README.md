## Hello, Vegan Recipes is pleased to welcome you.

  For this project, I wanted to create a cooking site with MEAN technology (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS and Node.js.)
  This the Ionic'version for the mobile site.
  I took as the basis the site [Recipesoriginales.fr](http://www.recettesoriginales.fr/).
  I brought some novelties like locating a restaurant's vegan or a store's vegan (more places not yet sorryâ€¦). 
  A page for all the publication on instagram are visible.
  
  As a user (if you log in) you will be able to publish your recipes and note those of the other members.
  I hope you enjoy this site. I wish you a good journey ;-)

  * my db.json is with the depot if you want to test some action. 





Ionic App Base
==============

A starting project for Ionic that optionally supports using custom SCSS.

## Using this project

We recommend using the [Ionic CLI](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-cli) to create new Ionic projects that are based on this project but use a ready-made starter template.

For example, to start a new Ionic project with the default tabs interface, make sure the `ionic` utility is installed:

```bash
$ npm install -g ionic cordova
```

Then run: 

```bash
$ ionic start myProject tabs --type=ionic1 --cordova
```

More info on this can be found on the Ionic [Getting Started](https://ionicframework.com/getting-started) page and the [Ionic CLI](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-cli) repo.
