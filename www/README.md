## Hello, Vegan Recipes is pleased to welcome you.

  For this project, I wanted to create a cooking site with MEAN technology (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS and Node.js.)
  This the Ionic'version for the mobile site.
  I took as the basis the site [Recipesoriginales.fr](http://www.recettesoriginales.fr/).
  I brought some novelties like locating a restaurant's vegan or a store's vegan (not yet sorryâ€¦). 
  A page for all the publication on instagram are visible.
  As a user (if you log in) you will be able to publish your recipes and note those of the other members.
  I hope you enjoy this site. I wish you a good journey ;-)




This is an addon starter template for the [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/).

## How to use this template

*This template does not work on its own*. It is missing the Ionic library, and AngularJS.

To use this, either create a new ionic project using the ionic node.js utility, or copy and paste this into an existing Cordova project and download a release of Ionic separately.

### With the Ionic tool:

Take the name after `ionic-starter-`, and that is the name of the template to be used when using the `ionic start` command below:

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic cordova
$ ionic start myApp sidemenu
```

Then, to run it, cd into `myApp` and run:

```bash
$ ionic platform add ios
$ ionic build ios
$ ionic emulate ios
```

Substitute ios for android if not on a Mac, but if you can, the ios development toolchain is a lot easier to work with until you need to do anything custom to Android.
